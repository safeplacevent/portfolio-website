        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi !! :3 I’m Sean, a 19-year-old artist who has been drawing and painting since I was a kid. Art has always been a huge part of my life, and over the years, it’s grown from a hobby into my biggest passion. I started out with just doodles and sketches, always experimenting with shapes, colors, and how I could bring my ideas to life.</p>

<p>When I was younger, I didn’t have much experience or knowledge about art, but I loved to create. As a teenager, I decided to share my art with the world, so I made an Instagram account to post my drawings. At the beginning, I had no followers at all, but I didn’t let that stop me. I kept posting my work, and slowly, I built a small community. After posting around 20 pieces, I managed to reach 700 followers, and that was a huge milestone for me. It showed me that people were starting to notice and appreciate what I was creating.</p>

<p>Over time, I realized that I wanted to focus more on painting. I felt like this was a new challenge that would help me grow as an artist. I started experimenting with different painting techniques and materials, such as acrylics and oils. Painting gives me a new way to express myself and explore ideas that I couldn't quite capture with just sketches. It feels like there’s no limit to what I can do, and that freedom excites me every day.</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve been thinking more seriously about turning my art into something I can support myself with. I’m not just creating for fun anymore – I want to make art my career. I’ve started offering my paintings for sale, taking on commissions, and looking for opportunities to collaborate with other artists or creatives. It’s a bit scary to think about making money from my passion, but it also motivates me to keep working hard and improving. My goal is to build something that will allow me to keep doing what I love full-time.</p>

<p>Throughout this journey, my style and skills have changed a lot. Every piece I create teaches me something new. I love experimenting with colors and different painting techniques, and I get inspired by the world around me, my own feelings, and the experiences I go through. Art isn’t just something I do – it’s a way for me to communicate with others. I hope that when people see my work, they can feel something and connect with it.</p>

<p>As an artist, I’m always learning, always growing. It’s not just about creating – it’s about sharing my story with the world and finding people who understand or appreciate what I do. Each new follower, comment, or piece of feedback pushes me to keep improving and challenges me to try new things. The art world can be tough, but I’m excited to keep going, take risks, and see where this journey leads.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, I’m excited for what the future holds. I want to keep growing as an artist, reaching more people, and trying new things with my work. I also hope to find more ways to turn my passion into a sustainable career so that I can do this for years to come. Thank you for being part of this adventure with me, and I can’t wait to share even more of my art with you as I continue to grow!</p>
